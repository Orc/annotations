Annotations is a collection of little programs that maintain weblogs.
It is extremely lightweight -- all it requires is a Unix system and
a C compiler.

Annotations takes a few shortcuts on how the weblog is set up.  The
configuration file for the weblog is always in the user htdocs directory
(typically ~user/htdocs), and all of the archive pages and other indexes
are also found there (you can have the weblog homepage be somewhere else,
but this is not well tested.)   The annotations(7) manpage describes the
various files and directories that annotations uses.


REQUIREMENTS

    1)	A modern Unix system (I've built it on Mastodon Linux,
	which is not exactly the most modern system, so more
	recent systems should be okay.)
    2)	A C compiler
    3)  A web server that supports Basic authentication and
        cgi scripts (I use a lightly hacked version of thttpd)
    4)  If you wish to publish articles via xml (using the Atom
	publishing format, which is the _only_ format I found
	documented), you need to install the expat and scew
	libraries.

Annotations is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.

I include a copy of Steven Koresh's uncgi program, which is also released
under a BSD-style license.  (look at uncgi/uncgi.c for the details)

The file INSTALL describes how to build and install this horrible
bodge of a program.
